# 3D Game Shaders For Beginners

Interested in adding
textures,
lighting,
shadows,
normal maps,
glowing objects,
ambient occlusion,
reflections,
refractions,
and more to your 3D game?
Great!
Below is a collection of shading techniques that will take your game visuals to new heights.
I've explained each technique in such a way that you can take what you learn here and apply/port it to
whatever stack you use—be it Godot, Unity, Unreal, or something else.
For the glue in between the shaders, I've chosen the fabulous Panda3D game engine and the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL).
So if that is your stack, then you'll also get the benefit of learning how to use these
shading techniques with Panda3D and OpenGL specifically.
